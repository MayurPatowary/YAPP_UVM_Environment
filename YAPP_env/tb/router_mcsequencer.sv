    The Channel UVCs continuously execute a single response sequence, so they do not need
    to be controlled by the multichannel sequencer.

    The Clock and Reset UVC could be controlled by the multichannel sequencer if, for
    example, we wanted to initiate reset during packet transmission. However, for simplicity
    weâ€™ll leave Clock and Reset out of the multichannel sequencer.
